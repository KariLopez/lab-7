The application will provide information about students in a class. First it will prompt the user to ask about a particular student, 
then the application will ask if the user would like to learn about that student's home town or favorite food and return that information.
If the user enters an invalid response, the application will respond accordingly to prompt a correct answer. 
Finally the app will ask if the user would like to learn about another student.
